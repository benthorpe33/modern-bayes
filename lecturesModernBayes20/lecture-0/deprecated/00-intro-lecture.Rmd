What is Bayesian Statistics?
===


"Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event. The degree of belief may be based on prior knowledge about the event, such as the results of previous experiments, or on personal beliefs about the event. This differs from a number of other interpretations of probability, such as the frequentist interpretation that views probability as the limit of the relative frequency of an event after many trials."

Course Objectives
===

- Provide a foundation to Bayesian statistical methods

- Explore, visualize, and analyze data in a reproducible and shareable manner using Bayesian methods from the course

- Gain experience in data wrangling and munging, building Bayesian models, visualizing them, and interpreting them 

- Work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions and data

- Learn to effectively communicate results through written assignments and exams



Unstable/slow internet?
===

Go to [https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/) and fork the repository. 

- The videos are compressed, and this was done on purpose for those in the class that might have slow internet. I would suggest that everyone forks the repository to avoid any issues. 

- Verify that you can play them (otherwise install something on your machine). 

- Make sure to pull the repository each day. I update the repository very often as all the course resources are here (homeworks, lectures, data, videos). If you don't pull often, you might run into some issues!


Class Meetings 
===

- Learn Bayesian statistical methods
- Lectures will consist of learning methodology and applied coding techniques
- You might find it useful to have a tablet/document camera for homeworks/OH/exams
- An alternative to this is using your phone to take pictures using Evernote (students have said this worked well in the spring). Please test things out in advance and make sure things are legible! 

Labs
===

- Labs will reinforce concepts learned in class using R 
- Apply concepts from lecture to real or synthetic data 
- Many labs will be finished as part of your homework  
- Bring fully-charged laptop to every lab

Activities & Assessments
===

- <font class="vocab">Homework</font>: Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills along with lab exercises. *Lowest score dropped.*

- <font class="vocab">Labs</font>: **Attending lab is highly encouraged**, and, there will be a lab problem on each homework each week. 

- <font class="vocab">Class/Lab</font>: **You will be responsible for keeping up with all class and lab material on a weekly basis (even though there are recordings)!** 

Class Engagement
===

0. Students are expected to have read the assigned reading before coming to class. 
1. Students are expected to have watched the pre-recorded videos. 
2. Prof. Steorts will go through the concepts in class again, highlighting the most important parts, providing clarifications, solutions/advice, and more advanced insights. 
3. Prof. Steorts will take questions (in person) or those that are posted in advance to Piazza by Monday at 10 AM EDT and Wed at 10 AM EDT. 
4. Prof. Steorts will provide exercises for the class to work through, practice exams, and an interactive environment. 
5. TAs will be present to help (as able and as available) in these activities such that we can break into small groups and students can receive more individualized attention. 

Lab Engagement 
===

0. Students are expected to have attempted the lab solutions before coming to lab and have watched the lab videos provided if they had trouble. 
1. Students are encouraged to post lab questions in advance to Piazza regarding lab, which should be posted no later than each Thursday at 5 PM EST. 
2. Each lab TA will go over all lab tasks, providing clarifications, solutions/advice, and more advanced insights. 
3. Each lab TA will take questions (in person) or go over those posted Piazza. 
4. You should always indicate what lab you are in to provide help to your TA. 
5. Attendance is highly encouraged in order to learn tips and tricks and in order to get hints/advice which are important for homeworks and exams.



Homeworks
===

1. Please see the syllabus regarding homework instructions for Sakai and Gradescope. 
2. Please start the homework early and not late. 
3. Ask questions early and post to Piazza.  
4. Your lowest homework will be dropped. 
5. All homework assignments can be submitted in Sakai and on Gradescope in case you wish to work ahead in the course. 

Remark: Sakai is for reproducible code (you will receive a grade for this). Gradescope is to make grading is done fairly/consistently for all students. Unfortunately, there is not a platform that handles both. 

**Please see the syllabus for all homework guidelines.**

Why Sakai + Gradescope?
===

1. Sakai will be used for reproducibility so this can be checked. This will account for part of your grade each assignment. 

2. Gradescope will be used to:

- return homework/exams more promptly
- ensure  complete  fairness
- allow  students  to  continue  to  learn  from  homeworks  by  reworking problems  without  the  right  answer  written  out  to  the  side

Exams
===

The format of the exams will be discussed closer to the time of the exam. The dates of the exams will be posted soon. 

Grade Calculation
===

<small>

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Exam 1 | 20% |
| Exam 2 | 20% |
| Exam 3 | 30% |

- See the syllabus for grade breakdowns. 
- Grades will **never** be curved down.

Absences
===

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 

- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic deanâ€™s office.

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

- What if I have COVID symptoms? 
  - Please do not come to class or return to class until you are cleared to come back. Forms can be found here:
  https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/illness


Late Work and Regrade Requests
===

- No late homeworks will be accepted, so please do not ask.  
    
- No make up exams will be given.  

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment was returned. 

Academic Honesty
===

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard. 

To uphold the Duke Community Standard:

- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.
Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

Reusing Code
===

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

Where to find help
===

- **If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in office hours, so please take advantage of these.

- Piazza: Outside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the forum since there are likely other students with the same questions. **Please be careful not to give away the answers to homework questions and please keep it polite/friendly on the forum.**

Academic Resource Center
===

Sometimes you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In that instance, I encourage you to visit the Academic Resource Center.  



The [Academic Resource Center (ARC)](https://arc.duke.edu) offers free services to all students during their undergraduate careers at Duke.
